# Creating Access Static Archive

This is a static version of the WP site created for Creating Access to HBCU Library Alliance Archives.

## About

This project uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate the site and does a clean content port of the [WordPress site](https://web.archive.org/web/20240527193015/https://creating-access.hbculibraries.org/).

## Local Development

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
