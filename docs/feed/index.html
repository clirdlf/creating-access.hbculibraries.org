										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April 11, 2022—<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new report from CLIR and the HBCU Library Alliance explores the common barriers and shared visions for creating access to archival collections held by libraries at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Chronicling nearly 300 years of the lived experiences and legacies of African Americans, these materials are vital to enriching our understanding of the achievements, influence, and global impact of African American people and communities. Many of these collections, however, remain inaccessible because of constraints in staffing, space, collections, equipment, and other resources.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/creating-access-to-hbcu-library-alliance-archives-needs-capacity-and-technical-planning/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating Access to HBCU Library Alliance Archives: Needs, Capacity, and Technical Planning</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of few reports that document the needs of HBCU libraries as they relate to archives and special collections. It is based on a series of online focus groups that author Sharon Ferguson Freeman facilitated with HBCU library directors and deans in 2021. The study provides insight into the significance of special and archival collections for HBCU librar­ies and their communities; the management and capacity of archives and special collections; and these libraries’ values, priorities, needs, and aspirations. The findings also reveal information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HBCUs and broader topics of significance that were not anticipated when the project began. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/Pub-180-cover.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-39230" src="https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/Pub-180-cover-235x300.png" alt="report cover" width="235" height="300" /></a>The collections described in the report encompass materials relating to organizational affiliations with churches, African American history, the civil rights movement, and institutional histories. Images from these collections are featured throughout the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire for additional staff, adequate space, digitization of collections, and expansion of collections emerged as key priorities among the focus group participants. Participants also expressed the wish for an endowment to be used exclusively to support archives and special collections.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The collections within HBCU libraries, the stories they uncover, the voices that must be amplified are more important now than ever before,” said HBCU executive director Sandra Phoenix. Our partnership with CLIR aims to f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oster awareness and access to diverse historical records that shaped American history, thus informing dialog to promote the common good. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work is a critical step to ensuring the preservation and accessibility of the authentic voice of African American history in the United States. It is imperative that history accurately reflects and acknowledges the innumerable contributions of generations of African Americans to the economic, social, and cultural development of our nation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project grew out of a</span><a href="https://www.clir.org/2019/07/clir-and-hbcu-library-alliance-form-national-partnership/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> formalized in 2019 between the HBCU Library Alliance and CLIR, and a 2020 Mellon Foundation</span><a href="https://www.clir.org/2020/11/hbcu-library-alliance-and-clir-receive-grant/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a study to inform a sustainable shared infrastructure for creating access to HBCU Library Alliance members’ archival collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“History is a dynamic inheritance, requiring diligent stewardship and rigorous assessment,” said CLIR president Charles Henry. “Our partnership with the HBCU Library Alliance and its archives seeks to assure that our national historical narrative is true, respectful, and multidimensional, to include voices that have been marginalized or suppressed, providing a more authentic understanding of our place and our selves.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating Access to HBCU Library Alliance Archives: Needs, Capacity, and Technical Planning </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is available as a freely downloadable pdf at <a href="https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/Creating-Access-to-HBCU-Library-Alliance-Archives.pdf">https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/Creating-Access-to-HBCU-Library-Alliance-Archives.pdf</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 11, 2021— The HBCU Library Alliance and the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) are pleased to introduce three highly skilled and knowledgeable consultants/researchers who will lead a series of focus groups and interviews with HBCU library leaders and staff. Their work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will help the HBCU Library Alliance to envision how its 76 member institutions can work together to preserve, describe, and digitize their unique collections. Selected through a highly competitive process, these researchers will work closely with Sandra Phoenix, executive director of the HBCU Library Alliance, throughout the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of this study will contribute to the articulation of common values, priorities, and needs for describing and managing special and archival collections for the HBCU Library Alliance community.</span></p>
<h4><b>Sharon Freeman:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Focus Group Facilitator </span></h4>
<p><b><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-114 alignleft" src="https://creating-access.hbculibraries.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2021/03/creatingaccess-freeman.png" alt="" width="250" height="300" /></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharon Ferguson Freeman holds a doctorate in professional studies in higher education leadership from Delta State University. After earning her bachelor’s degree in mathematics and computer science from Tougaloo College, Freeman began her career in higher education as a systems analyst in the James Herbert White Library at Mississippi Valley State University, where she currently serves as the assistant vice president for institutional research and effectiveness.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a focus on informed decision-making, Freeman has extensive experience in the fields of strategic planning, data analysis, institutional effectiveness, outcomes assessment, and higher education quality assurance. She currently serves as an evaluator and university liaison for the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, the regional accrediting body for southeastern states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an HBCU graduate and former library systems analyst, Freeman has a clear understanding of and appreciation for the unique challenges faced by libraries. She has recently worked as a statistician with the HBCU Library Alliance on their Expanding Library Support for Faculty Research project, which aims to assess and strengthen library services in support of faculty research. She is excited to return to her roots in the library to work with one of the HBCU Library Alliance’s most recent endeavors to expand access to cultural archives at its member institutions.</span></p>
<h4><b>Synatra Smith:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Interviewer</span></h4>
<p><b><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113 alignleft" src="https://creating-access.hbculibraries.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2021/03/creatingaccess_smith.png" alt="Image of Dr. Synatra Smith" width="250" height="300" /></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synatra Smith earned her PhD in global and sociocultural studies with a concentration in anthropology from Florida International University. Her research focuses on the creation, perpetuation, and transformation of the sociopolitical intersectional Black cultural landscape with special attention to the ways in which virtual and physical space are used to conceptually and practically transform Black identification processes, and the material culture that contributes to this phenomenon. She has been working in the galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) field for the past five years, officially in museum education, but she has also curated exhibits, worked in collections, and managed an outreach initiative, among other activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith is currently a CLIR postdoctoral fellow for digital curation and scholarship in African American Studies at the Philadelphia Museum of Art Library and Archives and the Temple University Libraries Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio, where she is exploring the myriad ways in which Black artists and scholars in Philadelphia reimagine and conceptualize their communities. She is working on capturing a broad spectrum of materials, from murals, zines/comics, posters, fashion/cosplay/textiles, and performance art, to 3-D models of sculptures and monuments and using linked data and mapping tools for data visualization. Outside of this fellowship, she is working on a multi-chapter report to historically contextualize the use of racially restrictive deed covenants in Hyattsville, Maryland, as a federally sanctioned method of residential segregation during the first half of the twentieth century.</span></p>
<h4><b>Portia D. Hopkins</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Interviewer</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-115 alignleft" src="https://creating-access.hbculibraries.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2021/03/creatingaccess-hopkins.png" alt="Image of Dr. Portia D. Hopkins" width="250" height="300" />Portia D. Hopkins holds a doctorate in American studies from the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park. As the 2020-2022 CLIR/DLF postdoctoral research associate in data curation for African American studies at Rice University, she teaches workshops, conducts outreach about data curation to African American activist groups in Houston, and assesses and inventories local data collections.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November 20, 2020— The HBCU Library Alliance and the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) have received a $75,000 planning grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for a project titled “Creating Access to HBCU Library Alliance Archives: Needs, Capacity, and Technical Planning.” The project will identify common barriers and shared visions for creating access to historic collections held by libraries at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).</p>
<figure id="attachment_25021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25021" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://digitalscholarship.tnstate.edu/library-digital-collections/191/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-25021" src="https://www.clir.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/Budding-engineers-300x235.jpg" alt="Students at Tennessee State" width="360" height="282" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-25021" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Budding mechanical engineers at Tennessee State University, </em>1968. Courtesy of Tennessee State University, Special Collections and Archives Brown-Daniel Library.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The rare and unique collections in the care of HBCUs, from historic documents to photographic prints and audiovisual media, contain a wealth of information about African American history, culture, and lives. However, many of these materials remain inaccessible. The project will enable the HBCU Library Alliance to envision how its 76 member institutions will work together to preserve, describe, and digitize the unique collections they steward.</p>
<p>“This project is a critical step to enable the discovery of previously ‘hidden’ primary resources at HBCUs that will enrich and broaden the existing body of knowledge about the African American experience,” said HBCU Library Alliance Executive Director Sandra Phoenix. “These archival collections will inform the scholarship produced by students, faculty, and other researchers, strengthening the accuracy and authenticity of the historical accounts about a resilient and accomplished race of people. The HBCU Library Alliance is so pleased to collaborate with CLIR to implement this exciting project.”</p>
<p>Guided by Phoenix and members of the HBCU Library Alliance Board of Directors, the project team will gather input from HBCU library leaders and staff about the ways rare and unique materials in their libraries are currently managed, how they are used, and how they imagine creating access to HBCU collections in the future.</p>
<p>“The funding for this project could not have come at a better time,” writes Monika Rhue, HBCU Library Alliance Board chair. “Our HBCU libraries serve as the keepers of some of the most unique materials which tell the stories of the history of the African American experience in our country. Due to the racial and social unrest of this year, it is even more critical to preserve these collections and find ways to increase access. The content and depth of these collections will create limitless opportunities for us to learn from the events of the past and prepare for a better future.”</p>
<p>CLIR President Charles Henry underlines the significance of the project: “Creating access to the archives of HBCU libraries is both timely and urgent. Making collections that center Black lives and histories widely available to all will enable us to fill gaps in both personal and public histories. CLIR remains committed to amplifying the voices of people whose stories have not yet been widely heard because of a lack of sufficient access, and we stand to learn valuable lessons from the HBCU library leaders and staff who will manage and contribute to this planning effort.”</p>
