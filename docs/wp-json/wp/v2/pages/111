She has recently worked as a statistician with the HBCU Library Alliance on their Expanding Library Support for Faculty Research project, which aims to assess and strengthen library services in support of faculty research. She is excited to return to her roots in the library to work with one of the HBCU Library Alliance\u2019s most recent endeavors to expand access to cultural archives at its member institutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-113\" src=\"https:\/\/creating-access.hbculibraries.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/37\/2021\/03\/creatingaccess_smith-150x150.png\" alt=\"Image of Dr. Synatra Smith\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creating-access.hbculibraries.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/37\/2021\/03\/creatingaccess_smith-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/creating-access.hbculibraries.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/37\/2021\/03\/creatingaccess_smith-70x70.png 70w, https:\/\/creating-access.hbculibraries.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/37\/2021\/03\/creatingaccess_smith-127x127.png 127w, https:\/\/creating-access.hbculibraries.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/37\/2021\/03\/creatingaccess_smith-125x125.png 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/>Synatra Smith: Interviewer<\/h4>\n<p>Synatra Smith earned her PhD in global and sociocultural studies with a concentration in anthropology from Florida International University. Her research focuses on the creation, perpetuation, and transformation of the sociopolitical intersectional Black cultural landscape with special attention to the ways in which virtual and physical space are used to conceptually and practically transform Black identification processes, and the material culture that contributes to this phenomenon. She has been working in the galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) field for the past five years, officially in museum education, but she has also curated exhibits, worked in collections, and managed an outreach initiative, among other activities.<\/p>\n<p>Smith is currently a CLIR postdoctoral fellow Fellow for Digital Curation and Scholarship in African American Studies at the Philadelphia Museum of Art Library and Archives and the Temple University Libraries Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio, where she is exploring the myriad ways in which Black artists and scholars in Philadelphia reimagine and conceptualize their communities. She is working on capturing a broad spectrum of materials, from murals, zines\/comics, posters, fashion\/cosplay\/textiles, and performance art, to 3-D models of sculptures and monuments and using linked data and mapping tools for data visualization. Outside of this fellowship, she is working on a multi-chapter report to historically contextualize the use of racially restrictive deed covenants in Hyattsville, Maryland, as a federally sanctioned method of residential segregation during the first half of the twentieth century.<\/p>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-115\" src=\"https:\/\/creating-access.hbculibraries.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/37\/2021\/03\/creatingaccess-hopkins-150x150.png\" alt=\"Image of Dr. Portia D.

As the 2020-2022 CLIR\/DLF postdoctoral research associate in data curation for African American studies at Rice University, she teaches workshops, conducts outreach about data curation to African American activist groups in Houston, and assesses and inventories local data collections. She is currently leading two oral history projects about African American life in Houston. Hopkins is the recipient of the Bode-Wise American Studies Fellowship and the Wiley Dissertation Fellowship at UMD.
