Chronicling nearly 300 years of the lived experiences and legacies of African Americans, these materials are vital to enriching our understanding of the achievements, influence, and global impact of African American people and communities. Many of these collections, however, remain inaccessible because of constraints in staffing, space, collections, equipment, and other resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clir.org\/pubs\/reports\/creating-access-to-hbcu-library-alliance-archives-needs-capacity-and-technical-planning\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating Access to HBCU Library Alliance Archives: Needs, Capacity, and Technical Planning<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of few reports that document the needs of HBCU libraries as they relate to archives and special collections. It is based on a series of online focus groups that author Sharon Ferguson Freeman facilitated with HBCU library directors and deans in 2021. The study provides insight into the significance of special and archival collections for HBCU librar\u00adies and their communities; the management and capacity of archives and special collections; and these libraries\u2019 values, priorities, needs, and aspirations. The findings also reveal information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HBCUs and broader topics of significance that were not anticipated when the project began.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clir.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2022\/04\/Pub-180-cover.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-39230\" src=\"https:\/\/www.clir.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2022\/04\/Pub-180-cover-235x300.png\" alt=\"report cover\" width=\"235\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>The collections described in the report encompass materials relating to organizational affiliations with churches, African American history, the civil rights movement, and institutional histories.
