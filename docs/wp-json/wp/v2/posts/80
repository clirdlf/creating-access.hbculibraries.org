However, many of these materials remain inaccessible. The project will enable the HBCU Library Alliance to envision how its 76 member institutions will work together to preserve, describe, and digitize the unique collections they steward.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis project is a critical step to enable the discovery of previously \u2018hidden\u2019 primary resources at HBCUs that will enrich and broaden the existing body of knowledge about the African American experience,\u201d said HBCU Library Alliance Executive Director Sandra Phoenix. \u201cThese archival collections will inform the scholarship produced by students, faculty, and other researchers, strengthening the accuracy and authenticity of the historical accounts about a resilient and accomplished race of people. The HBCU Library Alliance is so pleased to collaborate with CLIR to implement this exciting project.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Guided by Phoenix and members of the HBCU Library Alliance Board of Directors, the project team will gather input from HBCU library leaders and staff about the ways rare and unique materials in their libraries are currently managed, how they are used, and how they imagine creating access to HBCU collections in the future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe funding for this project could not have come at a better time,\u201d writes Monika Rhue, HBCU Library Alliance Board chair. \u201cOur HBCU libraries serve as the keepers of some of the most unique materials which tell the stories of the history of the African American experience in our country. Due to the racial and social unrest of this year, it is even more critical to preserve these collections and find ways to increase access. The content and depth of these collections will create limitless opportunities for us to learn from the events of the past and prepare for a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>CLIR President Charles Henry underlines the significance of the project: \u201cCreating access to the archives of HBCU libraries is both timely and urgent. Making collections that center Black lives and histories widely available to all will enable us to fill gaps in both personal and public histories. CLIR remains committed to amplifying the voices of people whose stories have not yet been widely heard because of a lack of sufficient access, and we stand to learn valuable lessons from the HBCU library leaders and staff who will manage and contribute to this planning effort.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/hbculibraries.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HBCU Library Alliance <\/a>is a consortium that supports the collaboration of information professionals dedicated to providing an array of resources to strengthen Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and their constituents.
